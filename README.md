ESLint & Code Quality
ECOBAZAR follows strict ESLint rules for maintainability. If you're working on the project, ensure ESLint is properly configured:

Expanding ESLint Configuration
If you're developing a production application, update your ESLint config for type-aware linting:

js
Copy
Edit
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
Use tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked or tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked for better type safety.

js
Copy

import react from 'eslint-plugin-react'

export default tseslint.config({
  settings: { react: { version: '18.3' } },
